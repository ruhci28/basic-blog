# basic-blog
It is a basic blogs application having all CRUD functionality. I made this project using React.js with Redux for state management and Material-UI.
Use the JSON Placeholder API to fetch, update,delete and create posts. It also have functionality of liking and disliking the post. It has a separate
page to display liked and disliked post. The project also  have a search functionality to search a post out of all the post available.
